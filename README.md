Bootloader RS485 slaves
======

More info to be found on the wiki:
http://wiki.openmotics.com/index.php/Bootloader

There are 2 versions: one for 18f45K80 and one for 18f46K80 with RS485 communication.
Then use the bat file to generate the combination version of the bootloader and the program itself. Otherwise you have a chicken egg problem. The Bootloader needs an address but that can only be set by the program. 
The Checksum will automatically be calculated the first time the program is started and the address type is set to 0xFF.
 
A bootloader version is made for every type of module because the leds and buttons are not assigned to the same pins. This can be set in ModuleType.h
